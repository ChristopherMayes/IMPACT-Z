IMPACT-Z is a parallel+serial particle-in-cell code whose primary purpose is to
model the dynamics of multiple charged particle beams in linear and ring acceler
ators. The code uses longitudinal position (z) as independent variable and inclu
des the effects of externally applied fields from magnets and accelerating cavit
ies as well as the effect of self-fields (space charge fields). Mathematically,
the code solves the Vlasov/Poisson equations using a particle-based technique. T
he code, which is written in Fortran90 with MPI, runs on both single-processor a
nd multi-processor systems. It has been applied to studies of halo formation and
 coupling resonance in high intensity beams, microbunching instability in high b
rightness electron linac, beam dynamics in SNS linac, JARPC linac, RIA driver li
nac, CERN superconducting linac, LEDA halo experiment, Proton Synchrotron at CER
N, etc.

To compile the ImpactZ code, one can follow the same procedure as described in
the ImpactT github Readme file.
